# myricat - Myrient Cataloger
_(pronouned My-Ree-Cat)_

myricat is an open-source CLI tool written in Go, designed to download large ROM collections off of [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me) using DAT files.

## Origin
There certainly exist other tools, the most prominent one being [dltool](https://github.com/kosmosnautti/dltool). They all didn't work for me or didn't feel rigid enough.

## (Planned) Features
### Core
- Bandwith utilization optimization
- Verfication of individual ROMs using checksums
- Verification of collection completeness
- Easy-to-use but powerful interactive interface
- Automatic download resumption after aborts
### Later / More Advanced
- A terminal user interface (TUI)
- Removal of DAT file requirement
- Option for dry run
- Whatever the community desires
